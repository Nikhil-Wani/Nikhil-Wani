<b>About</b>

I'm a Electronics and Telecommunications Engineer whose passion lies in computer programming. In my work as an engineer I've had to use a lot of counter intuitive software. Curious as to why these programs worked the way they do, I started learning how to code. As i started learning I've came across many technologies. One that amazed me is how an AI provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

This passion carried me through my education. I studied new languages, algorithms, technology, compilers. And it was here that i learned truly how much there was to learn yet.

Now I'm further expanding my knowledge in developing, implementing and integrating new application with Technical Proficiency C, C++, Java,Python, Cloud Computing.
